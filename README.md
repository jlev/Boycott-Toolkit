# Boycott-Toolkit
A web application to enable collaborative research for collective economic action.

Submitted as part of my [masters thesis](http://www.levinger.net/josh/files/writing/jlev-mas.pdf) at the [MIT Media Lab](http://media.mit.edu) [Center for Civic Media](https://civic.mit.edu).

Code originally written for Django 1.2; no guarantees it is still functional.
